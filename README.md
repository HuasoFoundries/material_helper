# material_helper
Materialize-css with AMD wrappings.

This package wraps Materialize-css in order to bundle velocity and hammer.js, while at the same time not relying in a global jQuery object.

Install it like so:

```
jspm install material_helper=github:HuasoFoundries/material_helper
```



To build the dist version, run:
```sh
make build
```
